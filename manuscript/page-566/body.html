Any one who will bestow one branch of it on me may, in return for it, ask whatsoever he desires.”</p><p>Then One-Eye and Three-Eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both tried very hard, but they were not able to do it, for every time the branches and fruit moved away from them.</p></div> </div>
