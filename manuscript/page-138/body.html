He took her on his horse as his Bride, and rode away with her. But when they passed by the hazel-tree, two little pigeons sat on it, and cried:</p><p>“<em>Turn and peep, turn and peep,</em><br><em>There’s blood within the shoe!</em><br><em>The shoe it is too small for her,</em><br>_The true Bride waits for you!_”</p><p>He looked down at her foot, and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking. Then he turned his horse and took the false Bride home again. “This also is not the right one,” said he. “Have you no other daughter?”</p><p>“No,” said the man; “there is only a little stunted kitchen-girl which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the Bride.”</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">The King’s Son said he was to send her up to him;</p></div> </div>
