Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat down in his chair and worked.</p><p>At length, when it was quite dark, Clever Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was frightened, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or not, and said, “Is it I, or is it not I?”</p><p>But she knew not what answer to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt. At length she thought, “I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I. They will be sure to know.”</p><p>She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut. Then she knocked at the window and cried, “Hans, is Elsie within?”</p><p>“Yes,” answered Hans, “she is within.”</p></div> </div>
