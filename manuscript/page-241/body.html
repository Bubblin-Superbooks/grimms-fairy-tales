She is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot. Walk nicely and quietly. Do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle; then your Grandmother will get nothing! When you go into her room, don’t forget to say ‘Good morning,’ and don’t stop to peep into every corner, before you do it.”</p><p>“I’ll take great care,” said Little Red-Cap to her Mother, and gave her hand on it.</p><p>The Grandmother lived in the wood, half an hour’s distance from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood,141 a Wolf met her. Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.</p><p>“Good-day, Little Red-Cap,” said he.</p><p>“Thank you kindly, Wolf.”</p><p>“Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?”</p></div> </div>
