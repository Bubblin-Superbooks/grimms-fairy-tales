Then he went into the country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow. There he soon saw with his own eyes, the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringing their flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair, which shone with radiance. And soon she said:</p><p>“<em>Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,</em><br><em>Blow Conrad’s little hat away,</em><br><em>And make him chase it here and there,</em><br><em>Until I’ve braided all my hair,</em><br>_And bound it up again._”</p><p>Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad’s hat, so that he had to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting her hair. All of which the King observed.</p></div> </div>
