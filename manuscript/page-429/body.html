Conrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste:</p><p>“<em>Blow, blow, thou gentle Wind, I say,</em><br><em>Blow Conrad’s little hat away,</em><br><em>And make him chase it here and there,</em><br><em>Until I’ve braided all my hair,</em><br>_And bound it up again._”</p><p>Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away, and Conrad was forced to run after it. When he came back, her hair had been put up a long time, and he could get none of it. So they looked after their geese till evening came.</p></div> </div>
