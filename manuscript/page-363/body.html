But she was much fonder of the ugly and lazy one. Every day, the other, poor girl, had to sit by a well in the highway, and <em>spin, spin</em> till her fingers bled.</p><p>Now it happened, one day, that the shuttle was stained with her blood. She dipped it in the well to wash the stains off, and it dropped out of her hand and fell to the bottom. She began to weep, and ran to the woman, and told her of the mishap.</p></div> </div>
