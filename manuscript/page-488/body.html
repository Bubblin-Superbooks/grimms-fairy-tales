I must and will have it!” She gave the maiden several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with her.</p><p>So she did the Old Woman’s bidding, placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful.</p><p>The huntsman asked, “Why do you stand there so sorrowfully?”</p><p>“Ah, my Beloved,” was her answer, “over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain, where the precious stones grow. I long for them so much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them? Only the birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.”</p><p>“Have you nothing else to complain of?” said the huntsman. “I will soon remove that burden from your heart.”</p></div> </div>
